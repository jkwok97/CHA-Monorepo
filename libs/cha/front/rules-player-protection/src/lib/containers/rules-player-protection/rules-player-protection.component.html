        If a CHA player does not play in the minimum required NHL games to
        qualify for CHA game disk eligibility, they are subject to the Player
        Protection Rule. The G.M. with the player's rights has 3 options:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Pay a $10 retainer fee (due with the following years dues) and not
          have the player count towards his/her roster maximum or salary cap
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not pay the $10 retainer fee. Instead, keep the player as a
          roster player counting towards the team's salary cap and roster
          maximum. This option is only available if the player has an NHL
          salary for that season. If the player in in another leafue for that
          season, the G.M. can select option 3.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do neither. The player would be released and considered elegible for
          the CHA entry draft when/if the player is eligible for the CHA game
          disk.
        </li>
