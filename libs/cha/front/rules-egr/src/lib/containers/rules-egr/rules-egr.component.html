        <li>
          Teams may carry no more than 3 and no less than 2 goaltenders at any
          given time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any team opting to carry 3 goaltenders is elegible for the Emergency
          Goaltender Rule (hereafter referred to as the EGR)
        </li>
        <li>
          In the case of an EGR eligible team losing all 3 goaltenders to
          injury, said team will receive the worst available goaltender from
          the waiver pool on loan until at least one of said team's roster
          goaltenders become available.
        </li>
        <li>
          Should another EGR eligible team require this service while the
          worst waiver pool goaltender is already in use, the next worse
          goaltender will be loaned and so on and so forth
        </li>
        <li>
          Any team opting to carry only 2 goaltenders is not eligible for the
          EGR
        </li>
        <li>
          In the case of a non-EGR eligible team losing both it's goaltenders
          to injury, said team will have a concurrently scratched roster
          player play goal
        </li>
        <li>
          During the playoffs, any goaltender qualifies as a backup regardless
          of NHL games played. Should a team's starting goaltender get
          injured, any roster goaltender then becomes available to start until
          the starter returns
        </li>
        <li>The EGR applies in the playoffs as well.</li>
