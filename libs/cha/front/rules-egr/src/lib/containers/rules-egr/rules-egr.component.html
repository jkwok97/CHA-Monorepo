            Teams may carry no more than 3 and no less than 2 goaltenders at any
            given time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any team opting to carry 3 goaltenders is elegible for the Emergency
            Goaltender Rule (hereafter referred to as the EGR)
          </li>
          <li>
            In the case of an EGR eligible team losing all 3 goaltenders to
            injury, said team will receive the worst available goaltender from
            the waiver pool on loan until at least one of said team's roster
            goaltenders become available.
          </li>
          <li>
            Should another EGR eligible team require this service while the
            worst waiver pool goaltender is already in use, the next worse
            goaltender will be loaned and so on and so forth
          </li>
          <li>
            Any team opting to carry only 2 goaltenders is not eligible for the
            EGR
          </li>
          <li>
            In the case of a non-EGR eligible team losing both it's goaltenders
            to injury, said team will have a concurrently scratched roster
            player play goal
          </li>
          <li>
            During the playoffs, any goaltender qualifies as a backup regardless
            of NHL games played. Should a team's starting goaltender get
            injured, any roster goaltender then becomes available to start until
            the starter returns
          </li>
          <li>The EGR applies in the playoffs as well.</li>
