          <li>
            Waiver claims will be made Sundays at 2 week intervals throughout
            the regular season (there may be occurences when this number varies)
          </li>
          <li>
            The first waiver claim of every year will be the first weekend
            immediately following the preseason
          </li>
          <li>
            The waiver wire will consist of all players on the disk not
            belonging to a CHA team
          </li>
          <li>
            All claims must have been sent (via email, Slack message or text
            message) by no later than 11:59 MST saturday evenings
          </li>
          <li>
            Claim priority will be determined initally by team standings for the
            year prior. Once a successful claim has been made, teams then drop
            to the bottom of the priority list. Teams will subsequently then
            only climb the priority list once another team with a higher
            priority makes a successful claim.
          </li>
          <li>All teams may participate in making a waiver claim</li>
          <li>
            Waiver priority only takes effect when two or more teams make a
            claim for the same player
          </li>
          <li>
            More than one player may be submitted for in the same claim. In such
            situations, claims must be formed in such a way that the highest
            prioritized player is first followed by second highest and so on and
            so forth
          </li>
          <li>
            Please try to restrict your player claims to no more than five
            players at one time
          </li>
          <li>
            In the case of a successful claim, the selected player(s) must be
            retained for the duration of at least one waiver interval (roughly 2
            weeks). If a team claim brings a roster total to more than league
            roster maximum (30 players) or to a total causing a salary cap
            infringement, players must be dropped by the day of the next set of
            games. If no drops are made, the league will perform the
            transactions by proxy.
          </li>
          <li>Waiver claim positions may not be traded.</li>
