      <ul>
        <li>
          Waiver claims will be made Sundays at 2 week intervals throughout
          the regular season (there may be occurences when this number varies)
        </li>
        <li>
          The first waiver claim of every year will be the first weekend
          immediately following the preseason
        </li>
        <li>
          The waiver wire will consist of all players on the disk not
          belonging to a CHA team
        </li>
        <li>
          All claims must have been sent (via email, Slack message or text
          message) by no later than 11:59 MST saturday evenings
        </li>
        <li>
          Claim priority will be determined initally by team standings for the
          year prior. Once a successful claim has been made, teams then drop
          to the bottom of the priority list. Teams will subsequently then
          only climb the priority list once another team with a higher
          priority makes a successful claim.
        </li>
        <li>All teams may participate in making a waiver claim</li>
        <li>
          Waiver priority only takes effect when two or more teams make a
          claim for the same player
        </li>
        <li>
          More than one player may be submitted for in the same claim. In such
          situations, claims must be formed in such a way that the highest
          prioritized player is first followed by second highest and so on and
          so forth
        </li>
        <li>
          Please try to restrict your player claims to no more than five
          players at one time
        </li>
        <li>
          In the case of a successful claim, the selected player(s) must be
          retained for the duration of at least one waiver interval (roughly 2
          weeks). If a team claim brings a roster total to more than league
          roster maximum (30 players) or to a total causing a salary cap
          infringement, players must be dropped by the day of the next set of
          games. If no drops are made, the league will perform the
          transactions by proxy.
        </li>
        <li>Waiver claim positions may not be traded.</li>
      </ul>
